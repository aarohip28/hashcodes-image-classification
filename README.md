# image-classification
Description: Build an image classification model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Train the model on a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) to classify images into 
specific categories.
Building an image classification model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch typically involves the following steps:

1) Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training. This step may involve resizing images, normalization, data augmentation, and splitting the dataset into
   training and validation sets.

2) Model Architecture: Choose an appropriate deep learning model architecture for image classification. Popular choices include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet, VGG,
   or MobileNet.

3) Model Compilation: Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

4) Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset using the compiled settings. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and features in the images.

5) Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset to assess its performance.

6) Model Testing: Test the model on a separate test dataset to measure its generalization ability.

7) Deployment (Optional): After obtaining a satisfactory performance, deploy the model for inference on new, unseen images.
